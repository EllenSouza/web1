                    <h3>Who are minions</h3>
                    <p class="justified">Minions are a male species of fictional yellow creatures that appear in Illumination's Despicable Me franchise. They are characterized by their childlike behavior and their language, which is largely unintelligible.
    
                        The Minions serve as the official mascots for Illumination, and have also been described by The New York Times as "corporate icons" for Comcast in the years since their 2013 purchase of Illumination's parent company NBCUniversal; similar to Mickey Mouse for The Walt Disney Company, Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. Discovery, SpongeBob SquarePants for Paramount Global, or Woody Woodpecker for Universal Studios.
                        
                        Kevin, Stuart, and Bob are three of the most familiar minions, who appear as stars in the film Minions (2015) and its sequel Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022). Many other Minions are mentioned by name in the films and other media in the franchise. They were created by art director Eric Guillon, who worked on several Illumination films.

                    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                    <p class="justified">
                    The Minions are small, yellow creatures shaped like pill capsules with round gray glasses. 
                    They are depicted as being roughly one-third to one-half the height of humans but they were later revealed to be 3 feet 7 inches (1.1 m) tall. 
                    They have one or two eyes, and their irises are almost always brown (except for Bob, who has one green and one brown eye). 
                    There appears to be no other difference between the two types beyond the number and color of eyes, and their height. 
                    They have no discernible noses but seem capable of smelling, as they are shown smelling fruit and are affected by the Fart Gun. 
                    They are also shown without ears but can hear and respond to sounds. 
                    Most Minions appear either bald or with a few wispy strands of black hair on their heads. 
                    After leaving their home country of Switzerland in favor of a new life in America during the late 1960s, their clothing consists of blue overalls emblazoned with Gru's logo, black rubber gloves, shoes, and goggles.

                    Minions, the 2015 animated feature film, shows that they have existed since the beginning of life on Earth. 
                    Minions are biologically wired to seek out and serve the most terrible of villains; when they have no "boss" to serve, they become depressed and listless.[2] 
                    They are also shown to have a degree of invulnerability, as Kevin, Stuart and Bob are able to survive a European torture chamber without any injuries, even playing with the torture devices. 
                    In the 2010 short film "Banana", the Minions are revealed to have an almost uncontrollable craving for fruit, especially bananas.
